title: Commit message cheatsheet

description: Echoing a quick reference to terminal

I dig the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) 
and the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) 
for git commit messages, but do not incorporate these guidlines as often as I would like within 
my own projects and defer to less informative messages.  To encourage myself to 
employ this convention more frequently I created a small script that prints a 
cheatsheet to terminal, so I can quickly reference notes highlighting the 
specification. Ultimately, I hope to maintain more meaningful git logs with my 
projects going forward.

Listed below is an example execution of ccc (Conventional Commit Cheatsheet).

```sh
âžœ ccc
